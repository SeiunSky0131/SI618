SI 618 22FA Data Manipulation and Analysis offered by UMSI

### About two projects
In this repo, I uploaded the projects I proposed for this course. Both of them are related to the US commercial aviation industry. I would say that as
a crazy avation fan, I really appreciate this course to offer me such an opportunity to do some actual data analysis and give insights to the aviation industry itself. 

### Project 1
In project 1, I focus on the recovery of the US international airlines after COVID. The key question is "Does the US commerical aviation industry completely recover from the COVID?"

### Project 2
In project 2, I focus on the US domestic airline airfare. The key questions is "What affects the airfare of the US domestic airline airfare? Is the airfare reasonable?"
