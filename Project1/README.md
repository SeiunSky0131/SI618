# Project 1: Recovery of the US Commercial Aviation Industry after COVID: An International View
### Background
I have been hearing from famous aviation YouTubers like Sam-Chui that the aviation industry is having its toughest years since the COVID pandemic. But I have never looking at the details by myself. Instead of just believing it to be true, I think analyzing it by myself can convince myself better. As a crazy aviation fan, I want to get some insights to the current aviation industry.

### General Information
In this project, I am trying to analyze the US commerical aviation industry situation after 1990. I am trying to ask myself following questions:
1. What is the impact of COVID on the US commercial aviation industry?
2. Has the US commercial aviation industry recovered completely from the COVID pandemic?
3. Is there any significant structural change made by the COVID pandemic to the US commercial aviation industry?

   a. Is there a significant change in top international destinations considering the flights departed from the US?
   
   b. Is there a significant change in US airports rank considering the flights departed from the US?
   
   c. Is there a significant change in top airline carriers considering the flights departed from the US?

4. What are the current operating conditions of the US commercial aviation industry? Does the accident rate increase?
5. When will the US commercial aviation industry reach the scale before the COVID pandemic?
6. ...

I hope that by answering these questions, I can know the aviation industry better. And if possible, give my naive suggestions to airline carriers to help them go through this tough period.
